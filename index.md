I'm a journalist at sea.

Recently, I quit my job and moved onto *Argo*, a 32-foot sailboat. (Not exactly in that order: there was a brief awkward period of digging out clothes from a laundry basket under my desk in a futile attempt to come off as civilized and presentable). As did my partner.

Now we're preparing *Argo* in Sydney, Australia, for a longer voyage. 

Where, you ask? What an excellent question. I am so glad you asked. 

It depends, for one, on how seasick we get. And for another, how much we like sailing. And whether, through some miracle, we can avoid throwing each other off the boat.

What do we mean, we don't know how we like sailing? We don't know how seasick we get?

I will tell you that story, but first I need to get this new website up and running.
