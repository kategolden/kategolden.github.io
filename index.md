I'm a journalist at sea.

Recently, I quit my 9-5 job and moved onto *Argo*, a 32-foot sailboat. (Not exactly in that order: there was a brief awkward period of digging out clothes from a laundry basket under my desk in a futile attempt to come off as civilized and presentable). As did my partner.

Now we're preparing *Argo* in Sydney, Australia, for a longer voyage. 

Where, you ask? What an excellent question. I am so glad you asked.

It depends, for one, on how seasick we get. And for another, how much we like sailing. And whether, through some miracle, we can avoid throwing each other off the boat.

What do we mean, we don't know how we like sailing?

Yes. Well. You can hear more about how this goes by signing up to my newsletter, which starts in October 2017. I aim for somewhere between weekly and monthly updates, internet willing.
