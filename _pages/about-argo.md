*Argo* is a Nicholson 32, a classic Bermuda sloop.

We bought her from a Pittwater ship's captain and marine surveyor, for about AU$20,000. He had acquired her a few years back for his two teenaged boys, but they moved on to other, faster hobbies like racing dirt bikes. So *Argo* was musty from disuse, and more set up for short cruises and drinking out of plastic champagne flutes than for living aboard and cruising oceans.

Wes and I both liked *Argo*'s simplicity and classic lines. She had just the right profile for us: a well-built monohull with a long deep keel and a protected rudder. The Nicholson 32 was built for several decades and has an excellent reputation for not getting knocked down at sea. Whatever else you care about in a boat, not dying is primary.

Less stuff means less to break. But I had doubts. Her cabin space was very small, even compared to other boats of similar length. The cabin was exceptionally dingy. Black mold was thriving. She smelled like diesel. And: no oven. I believe that ovens are key to the liberation of the cook.

On the other hand, she was about half the price of the boat we had just put an offer on but walked away from — and after kitting out would still probably be $15,000 to $20,000 cheaper.

The captain had said she was built around 1979. But online, we found drawings showing various Nicholson layouts over the decades suggesting she was about 15 years older.

Maybe *Argo* is one of the Nicholson 32s that were built in Sydney back in the 1960s. Back then, the *Sydney Morning Herald* did a front-page splash when the molds came down from England, and again when the first boat came off the line.

She came with old waxed charts that were published in 1963:
